Tamang are also a significant minority in Sikkim and Darjeeling District of West Bengal of India as permanent settlers; their languages are fifth most spoken in Nepal (note all Tamang languages are not mutually intelligible). They were one of the aborigines who were least affected by Nepalisation. Peculiar to Tamang people are complex marriage restrictions within the community.",

The surname \"Sherpa\" was adapted and involuntarily used as last names even though last names are not part of Sherpa culture. Most Sherpa people live in Nepal's eastern regions; however, some live farther west in the Rolwaling valley and in the Helambu region north of Kathmandu. Tengboche is the oldest Sherpa village in Nepal. Sherpa people also live in Tibet, Bhutan, as well as in the Indian states of Sikkim and the northern portion of West Bengal, specifically the district of Darjeeling. The Sherpa language belongs to the south branch of the Tibeto-Burman languages, and it is a mix of Eastern Tibet (Khamba) and Lhasa dialogue. However, this language is separate from Lhasa Tibetan and unintelligible to Lhasa speakers.",

It is a member of the family Felidae with a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.Fossil records suggest that in the Late Pleistocene it occurred in Europe and Japan Compared to other members of Felidae, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique. Its fur is marked with rosettes similar to those of the jaguar, but the leopard's rosettes are smaller and more densely packed, and do not usually have central spots as the jaguar's do. Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers. The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behaviour, broad diet, and strength (which it uses to move heavy carcasses into trees), as well as its ability to adapt to various habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas, and its ability to run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour (36 mph).",

The region is mountainous and lies just south of the Dhaulagiri massif. The Chhantyal language is a member of the Tamangic group [along with Gurung, Thakali, Manangba, Nar-Phu and Tamang]. Within the group, it is lexically and grammatically closest to Thakali. Assessment of the internal relations within the group is complicated by a number of factors, among which is the fact that shared innovations may be the product of geographic contiguity as much as shared genetic background. Chhantyal, however, is in many respects the most deviant member of the group, lacking a tone system and having borrowed a large portion of its lexicon from Nepali. In addition, there appears to be a layer of Tibeto-Burman vocabulary that is not Tamangic.",

The basic form of most mandalas is a square with four gates containing a circle with a centre point. Each gate is in the general shape of a T. Mandalas usually exhibit radial balance. The term appears in the Rigveda as the name of the sections of the work, but is also used in other religions and philosophies, particularly Buddhism. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a sacred space, and as an aid to meditation and trance induction.",

The entire massif and surrounding area is protected within the 7,629 square kilometres (2,946 sq mi) Annapurna Conservation Area, the first and largest conservation area in Nepal.

That said, it may also heighten the risk for the group as a whole because, unfavourable conditions, the fall of a single member may pull the entire party down as well. When climbing or in steep terrain where there is a high risk of falling, the rope is also secured to fixed points in the rock or ice. At the same time a \"sliding rope\" (gleitendes Seil) may be used or the rope may be fixed to a top anchor (Standplatz). A distinction is made between groups of two, three and four persons.",

It is located in the Mansiri Himal, part of the Nepalese Himalayas, in the west-central part of Nepal. Its name, which means \"mountain of the spirit\", comes from the Sanskrit word manasa, meaning \"intellect\" or \"soul\". Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956 by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that \"just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain\". Manaslu Peak Manaslu is the highest peak in the Gorkha District and is located about 64 km (40 mi) east of Annapurna. The mountain's long ridges and valley glaciers offer feasible approaches from all directions, and culminate in a peak that towers steeply above its surrounding landscape, and is a dominant feature when viewed from afar.",

"item_desc": "Yaks are heavily built animals with a bulky frame, sturdy legs, and rounded cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur that hangs down lower than the belly. While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown, in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite variable in colour, often having patches of rusty brown and cream. They have small ears and a wide forehead, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour. In males, the horns sweep out from the sides of the head, and then curve forward; they typically range from 48 to 99 cm (19 to 39 in) in length. The horns of females are smaller, only 27 to 64 cm (11 to 25 in) in length, and have a more upright shape. Both sexes have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the shoulders, although this is larger and more visible in males.[3] Males weigh 350 to 580 kg (770 to 1,280 lb), females weigh 225 to 255 kg (496 to 562 lb). Wild yaks can be substantially heavier, males reaching weights of up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb).",

"item_desc": "Manufactured in St. Petersburg Russia, the POISK oxygen cylinders are much demanded for climbing of Mt. Everest and other high 8000- meter peaks. Its volume, size and dimensions have been optimally designed to fit the needs of the high altitude climbers. Most oxygen systems require carrying a heavy bottle to the summit even though it may be close to empty The POISK system is designed to use two to three bottles for a summit day of 12 to 18 hours. This allows you to drop and empty bottle on the way to the summit and pick up a strategically placed bottle on the descent if needed. This way you have only one third the weight on your back as you approach the summit. The adjacent photo is a picture of oxygen cylinders the Sherpas retrieved from high on the mountain. In the past many bottles have been left behind on the mountain causing worldwide attention around the debris left behind by expeditions. Today Sherpas are paid a fee to return them for refilling. One POISK –3 high-pressure bottles filled to 260 Bar at 20 degrees Celsius weighs under six pounds (2.7 kg). The dimensions of the bottle are 19 inches long and 4.25 inches in diameter. Four bottles can easily fit into a medium size pack. These bottles are extremely reliable and easy to use. At a 2- liter per minute flow the bottles last approximately 6.5 hours..",
